Create a todo list for updating and expanding the documentation. For every individual item—such as each meta file, hook, library, or panel—ensure there is a unique, checkable box, so you can track specific progress on a granular level. Organize these checkboxes into the following 6 steps:

1. **Revise Module Metadata**  
   - Make sure there are checkboxes for:  
     - Reviewing and updating the `MODULE.name`
     - Reviewing and updating the `MODULE.desc`
   - Double-check all module metadata in the code and ensure a checkbox is present for each item that must be revised or updated.

2. **Write Headers**  
   - For each detected meta file, hook, library, and panel, create a checkbox and add it to the todo list.
   - Each file requiring a header should have its own checkbox. Use the header format from `template.md` for each.

3. **Document Meta Functions**  
   - In `documentation/docs/meta`, make a checkbox for every meta function that still needs documentation. 
   - There should be one checkbox per meta function, ensuring you can track and check off each function individually as it's documented.

4. **Document Hooks**  
   - In `documentation/docs/hooks`, add a checkbox for each undocumented hook.
   - Make sure every hook found in the codebase appears as an individual checkbox, to be checked off as completed.

5. **Document Libraries**  
   - In `documentation/docs/libraries`, include a checkbox for every library documented or needing documentation.
   - Every library should have its own checkbox, checked off as that library's documentation is addressed.

6. **Document Panels**  
   - In `documentation/docs/panels`, include a checkbox for every panel.
   - Be certain that all panels appearing in the codebase are represented by their own checkbox for documentation completeness and tracking.

**Important:** For every step, the todo list should provide an individual checkable box for each meta, hook, library, panel, or any other relevant item. Do not group them together; each must have its own checkbox. As items are documented, mark their boxes as completed—this allows you and others to monitor progress clearly and ensure that nothing is missed. Always cross-reference your todo list with the source code to keep the checklist accurate and up to date.
