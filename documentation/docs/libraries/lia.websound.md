# WebSound Library

This page explains how remote sounds are downloaded and cached.

---

## Overview

The web-sound library downloads remote audio files and stores them inside
`data/lilia/sounds/<IP>/<Gamemode>/`. Each server therefore keeps its own
collection of downloaded sounds. The library overrides `sound.PlayFile` and
`sound.PlayURL` so HTTP(S) URLs may be passed directlyâ€”the file is downloaded,
cached and then played. Subsequent calls using the same URL will reuse the
previously saved file and you may also pass the cached name to
`sound.PlayFile`.

### lia.websound.register

**Purpose**

Downloads a sound from the given URL and saves it in the web-sound cache. If the
file already exists locally the callback fires immediately with the cached
filename. On HTTP failure the callback receives `nil` and an error string.

**Parameters**

* `name` (*string*): Unique file name including extension.
* `url` (*string*): HTTP address of the sound file.
* `callback` (*function | nil*): Called as `callback(path, fromCache, err)` where
  `path` is the local file path relative to `DATA/`, `fromCache` is `true` if
  loaded from disk and `err` is an error string on failure.

**Realm**

`Client`

**Returns**

* *nil*: This function does not return a value.

**Example Usage**

```lua
-- Download a sound and play it when ready
lia.websound.register("alert.mp3", "https://example.com/alert.mp3", function(path)
    if path then
        sound.PlayFile(path, "", function(chan) if chan then chan:Play() end end)
    end
end)
```

### lia.websound.get

**Purpose**

Returns the file path cached with `lia.websound.register`. If the file is
missing `nil` is returned. Both `sound.PlayFile` and `sound.PlayURL` call this
internally when a cached name or matching URL is supplied.

**Parameters**

* `name` (*string*): File name used during registration.

**Realm**

`Client`

**Returns**

* *string | nil*: Local data path or `nil` if not found.

**Example Usage**

```lua
-- Retrieve a cached sound and play it
local path = lia.websound.get("alert.mp3")
if path then
    sound.PlayFile(path, "", function(chan) if chan then chan:Play() end end)
end

-- Play directly from the web
sound.PlayFile("https://example.com/alert.mp3", "", function(chan)
    if chan then chan:Play() end
end)
```
