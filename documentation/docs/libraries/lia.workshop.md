# Workshop Library

This page documents Workshop-addon helpers.

---

## Overview

The workshop library tracks required Workshop addon IDs and mounts them on clients to ensure players have the assets needed for the gamemode. When the **`AutoDownloadWorkshop`** configuration is enabled, connecting players automatically receive the cached list of IDs so missing content can be downloaded.

Workshop IDs added via `lia.workshop.AddWorkshop` are stored in `lia.workshop.ids`. After all modules are initialised, `lia.workshop.cache` holds the combined set that clients will download. For convenience, `resource.AddWorkshop` is aliased to `lia.workshop.AddWorkshop`.
Clients store the list received from the server in `lia.workshop.serverIds`, which drives the in-game display and download queue.

`lia.workshop.send` is called \~10 seconds after each playerâ€™s initial spawn when automatic downloading is enabled. Clients may run `workshop_force_redownload` in the console to forcibly re-download all configured addons.
