PUBLIC SERVICE ANNOUNCEMENT FOR NUTSCRIPT SERVER OWNERS

There is a ENOURMOUS performance issue with ULX Admin mod.
Nutscript Development Team found ULX is the main issue
that make the server freeze when player count is higher
than 20-30. The duration of freeze will be increased as you get
more players on your server.

If you're planning to open big server with ULX/ULib, Nutscript
Development Team does not recommend your plan. Server Performance
Issues with ULX/Ulib on your server will be ignored and we're
going to consider that you're taking the risk of ULX/Ulib's
critical performance issue.

Nutscript 1.2 only displays this message when you have ULX or
ULib on your server.
