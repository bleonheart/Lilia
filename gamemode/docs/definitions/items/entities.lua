    Entities Item Definition

    Entity placement item system for the Lilia framework.

    Entity items allow players to place down entities in the world.
    They support data restoration and various entity properties.

    PLACEMENT:
    - Place in: ModuleFolder/items/entities/ItemHere.lua (for module-specific items)
    - Place in: SchemaFolder/items/entities/ItemHere.lua (for schema-specific items)

    USAGE:
    - Entity items are placed by using the item
    - They spawn the entity specified in ITEM.entityid
    - Entities are placed at the player's position
    - Items are consumed when placed
    - Entities can be picked up and returned to inventory
