--[[
    Purpose:
        Retrieves a character by its ID, loading it if necessary.

    When Called:
        When a character needs to be accessed by ID, either from the server or the client.

    Parameters:
        - charID (number): The unique identifier of the character.
        - client (Player): The player requesting the character (optional).
        - callback (function): Function to call when the character is loaded (optional).

    Returns:
        Character object if found or loaded, nil otherwise.

    Realm:
        Shared (works on both server and client).

    Example Usage:

        Low Complexity:

        ```lua
        -- Simple: Get a character by ID
        local character = lia.char.getCharacter(123)
        if character then
            print("Character name:", character:getName())
        end
        ```

        Medium Complexity:

        ```lua
        -- Medium: Get character with callback for async loading
        lia.char.getCharacter(123, client, function(character)
            if character then
                character:setMoney(1000)
                print("Character loaded:", character:getName())
            end
        end)
        ```

        High Complexity:

        ```lua
        -- High: Get multiple characters with validation and error handling
        local charIDs = {123, 456, 789}
        local loadedChars = {}

        for _, charID in ipairs(charIDs) do
            lia.char.getCharacter(charID, client, function(character)
                if character then
                    loadedChars[charID] = character
                    if table.Count(loadedChars) == #charIDs then
                        print("All characters loaded successfully")
                    end
                else
                    print("Failed to load character:", charID)
                end
            end)
        end
        ```
